    <string name="faq_8_text">Adding a folder at the Included Folders doesn\'t automatically exclude anything. What you can do is go in Settings -&gt; Manage Excluded Folders, exclude the root folder \"/\", then add the desired folders at Settings -&gt; Manage Included Folders. That will make only the selected folders visible, as both excluding and including are recursive and if a folder is both excluded and included, it will show up.</string>
